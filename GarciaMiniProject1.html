   <p>From this semester, my favorite class is woodworking. Sometimes it can be hard and I dont get it but in the end, it is fun. 
      Even though the people in that class are class clowns, it is fun. We get to make cabinets, and a drawer, and we can take them home.
      Right now we are doing measurements but when we get started on doing wood, it is going to be awesome. That is my favorite class this semester.</p>
